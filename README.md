# FolderAutoCleaner
Folder Auto Cleaner is a simple program for moving files out of a directory to another directory, in which it will create subfolders for each file type(extension). It is useful if you want to clean your for example Downloads folder to another drive, freeing up space on your system drive. It requires a config file with build as such:

src_folder: enter source

dst_folder: enter destination
.
It has a progress number in the console, as well as logs it progress in it's directory.
